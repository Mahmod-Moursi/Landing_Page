          <p>
            My name is Mahmoud Moursi, I'm a computer science graduate and 22
            years old.
          </p>

          <p>
            I chose my major because I liked many fields of software development
            and some of which I wanted to pursue professionally, such as web
            development and mobile application. Moreover, I have been fascinated
            by data mining and artificial intelligence implementation in many
            fields.

          <p>
            During my bachelor's degree, I learned java and took a web
            development course in which I learned and practiced using languages
            such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript when it comes to working in
            front-end development as well as PHP in back-end development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have also taken some optional courses that interested me such as
            android application development using android studio and systems
            programming & administration using shell scripts.

            I had a field training course during one of my summer vacations and
            in it, I worked with a team to develop an online library for the
            universities’ courses, I worked on the front-end of the online
            library using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap while my colleagues worked on
            the back-end. I took this opportunity to understand and get a better
            look at the working environment of our field.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had two online courses as a part of a scholarship launched by
            Future Work is Digital initiative with Udacity, the first was a web
            development course and the second was a software testing course.

              Third place at an on-paper java programming contest<br />During my
              third semester as a junior student.

            <li>
              First place at DevelopforCOVID19 hackathon<br />Organized by my
              university, I came up with the idea and the design of a smartphone
              application that provides diagnoses for covid-19 based on users’
              inputs and worked with my partner on a prototype.

            I developed an online survey that is meant to evaluate and enhance
            the level of cybersecurity awareness of the students in my
            university, I have worked on both the front-end and the back-end of
            the survey so that the survey would come up with suggestions to the
            participant depending on what areas they do not have a high level of
            awareness in and made a page that would display charts showing
            information about the participants and their answers using the data
            stored in the database and I have tasked my partner to come up with
            the questions for the survey.

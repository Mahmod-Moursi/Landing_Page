## The Functionalities

- The dynamic navigation
- The dynamic active class for sections
- The scrolling effect
- This project has the scope of converting a static web page into a single interactive page.
- It uses javascript to dynamically create navigation bar links based on the content, when a section is in view it shows the active state of that section as well as highlights the link of that section in the navigation bar.

## What did we learned

- In this project, we converted the static web landing page to a dynamic page
- In this project, we found out how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site
- In this project, we were able to dynamically create and add elements to our page based on the already existing elements in it.

## How to use the project

- First, open your browser
- Second you click `ctrl+o`
- Third you navigate to your index.html and open it
- During the scrolling, the section being viewed will be highlighted as well as their corresponding links in the navigation bar
- When scrolling past a configurable buffer, a new element will appear close to the bottom of the page. The users can use this element to scroll to the very top of the page

## Updates and future changes

- A final section would allow the user to create a new section at well by clicking a button that creates a new plain section as a way to demonstrate how the code dynamically creates and adds elements
- Make sections collapsible
- Hide the fixed navigation bar while not scrolling
